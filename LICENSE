================================================================================

ACADEMIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION:

This software implements Tiny Recursion Models (TRM) based on published 
academic research:

Paper: "Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks"
Author: Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau
Affiliation: Samsung SAIL Montr√©al
Publication: arXiv:2510.04871 (2024)

The TRM implementation in this project is an original implementation inspired
by the methodology described in the above paper, not derived from any 
proprietary Samsung source code.

DERIVED FROM TRILL-AI PROJECT:

MillenialAi is derived from and builds upon the Trill-AI project by Jovan Blango
(https://github.com/izreal1990-collab/Trill-Ai), which provided the foundational
TRM architecture concepts. This project extends those concepts with revolutionary
Layer Injection Architecture for seamless TRM-LLM integration.

NOVEL CONTRIBUTIONS:

This project represents the first known implementation of direct layer injection
between Tiny Recursion Models and Large Language Models using PyTorch forward
hooks, creating a revolutionary hybrid architecture for enhanced reasoning
capabilities.

PATENT DISCLAIMER:

This implementation may be subject to existing or future patents on recursive 
reasoning methods, TRM architectures, layer injection techniques, or hybrid AI 
systems. Users should conduct their own patent analysis and freedom-to-operate 
assessment for commercial applications. The authors make no warranty regarding 
patent infringement.
