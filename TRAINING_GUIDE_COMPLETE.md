## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues**

**Issue: CUDA Out of Memory**
```bash
# Solution: Reduce batch size
# Edit train_millennialai.py line 45:
batch_size=2  # Instead of 4
```

**Issue: Training Too Slow**
```bash
# Solution: Reduce epochs or use CPU
# Edit train_millennialai.py:
num_epochs=50  # Instead of 100
# Or force CPU:
device = 'cpu'
```

**Issue: Training Loss Not Decreasing**
```bash
# Solution: Adjust learning rates
learning_rate_complexity = 0.002  # Increase from 0.001
learning_rate_thinking = 0.001     # Increase from 0.0005
```

**Issue: Model Not Improving**
```bash
# Solution: Generate more diverse training data
# Run training_data_generator.py with more samples:
conversations = generator.generate_conversation_pairs(num_pairs=1000)
```
